## Goals and Objectives:
The goal of our project is to create an Intelligent bot that, when given a url or document that
contains a body of text, will print a summary of the article. The bot will then wait for the user to
input any questions they may have about the article and then print out the answer, based on
contents within the article.

- *Motivation:* Ease of accessibility of information from large legal documents, lengthy news
articles, and other large documents/text bodies.

- *Significance:* This will allow someone to quickly navigate through large bodies of text
while being able also obtain the information they need.

- *Objectives:* Our code will be able to summarize both an article pulled from a url and text
pulled from an uploaded document. The user will then be able to then ask the Intelligent
bot questions about the content of the article/document. The bot will answer these
questions based on the contents within the text body.

- *Features:* Use of machine learning to condense text and answer questions pertaining to
the document/article. Planned language to use: Python.
